<b>About</b>
Gerald and Susan have served on the mission field since 1981. Since 1987 we have worked in Jalulusiteli a remote Yanomamö village deep in the jungles of Amazonas, Venezuela. The only way into the village is either by jungle trail or by  boat. 
We presently have a church there and minister to the Yanomamö by meeting their spiritual and physical needs  through the church, mens morning classes, teaching school and literacy, and medical needs.
