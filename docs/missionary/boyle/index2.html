                <b>Location:</b> South Sudan

<b>Sending Church:</b> The Falls Church, VA
<b>Ministry Started:</b> 2003
<b>Duration:</b> Full-Time

<b>About</b>
God developed in me a heart for the Nations through International student ministry beginning in 1984. I was mentored by YES Missionary Leiton Chinn during the years of International Student Ministry. In 1988 I went on my first overseas ministry trip taking a group of teenagers on a YWAM Mission to Mexico. In 1992 I began ministry trips to South and Central Africa. In the mid 90â€™s I began to feel a burden for Southern Sudan after coming to know a number of Southern Sudanese refugees in the Washington D.C. area and hearing of their struggles before leaving South Sudan. In 1999, while Sudan was in the middle of war, I was invited to be part of a Team to the South. Our team was bombed during that trip along with other local civilians.

<b>Ministry</b>
I have been traveling back to Southern Sudan every year since 1999, supporting the indigenous church through teaching and by raising support for medical help, care for orphans, scholarships for pastors, and other practical support. More recently an outreach to Muslim Darfurians who are coming into the region in Northern Bahr El Ghazal has developed. I also work through IRD in Washington on advocacy issues for Sudan.

<b>Personal Message</b>
I am grateful for the faithful financial support of the many friends who have stood with me and believed in and encouraged me over the years. May the Lord bless you back as you are such a blessing to the many that we reach through your support.
