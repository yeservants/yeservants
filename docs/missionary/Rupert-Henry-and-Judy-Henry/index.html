<b>About</b>
Evangelist Rupert Henry and his wife, Judy Henry, have dedicated over two decades to prayer, support, and ministry for Foster Youth and families in need.<br>
Evangelist Rupert Henry serves as the director of both the Foster Youth Connection and The Surrender All Project.<br>
The primary mission of the Foster Youth Connection is to provide spiritual guidance and facilitate adoptions or foster placements for our most vulnerable children. Additionally, we focus on offering financial assistance to youth transitioning out of the foster care system. With divine guidance, FYC annually contributes to the Foster Youth Connection Fund, which aids our aging-out Foster Youth.
Each May, the City of Kissimmee, Florida, observes Foster Youth Connection Month and presents a proclamation, recognizing the importance of our cause. Furthermore, every first Tuesday in May, we host a "Meet at the Hall" event at Kissimmee City Hall. Local foster youth agencies, churches, and community organizations come together to provide information and support for our foster youth.<br>
Our overarching vision, with divine support, is to expand this ministry across the United States and worldwide.
The Surrender All Project, led by Evangelist Rupert Henry, affectionately known as Bredda Rups, is an evangelistic outreach ministry that has touched lives throughout the United States, the Caribbean Islands, and South America. Our calling is rooted in Matthew 28:17-20, spreading the message of Jesus Christ worldwide.
Through the leading of the Holy Spirit, we find it a privilege to work together as the Body of Christ, advancing the Kingdom of God. Our ultimate goal is to inspire souls and offer salvation through Jesus Christ's gift (Romans 6:23). The Surrender All Project utilizes workshops, Gospel music, and the teaching and preaching of God's word to encourage and mobilize the army of God, spreading the Good News of Jesus Christ to every person, nation, and tongue.

On behalf of my wife, Judy, and our family, we pray that the Lord will lead you into all truth. Surrender all to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and be encouraged. Blessings!
Evangelist Rupert and Judy Henry
