<b>About</b>
Lucy Hsu has been involved with cross-cultural ministry since 2000. She volunteered then became a staff member at the International Christian Church of San Diego (ICCSD) in 2003. She participated in multiple facets at ICCSD, which included one-on- one discipleship, evangelistic outreaches, leading small group Bible studies, and administrative work. She was also on the planning team for the INK Conference, which focused on providing training for post-academic transitions. In 2006, Lucy moved to Madison, Wisconsin. She served as the National Administrator for the International Student Ministry at InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. She also discipled and mentored a number of women international students. In 2009 Lucy and her family moved to Austin, Texas as her husband, Art, became a pastor at Austin Chinese Church. Lucy and Art are proud parents of two boys. Lucy has a Master of Arts in Theology from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California.

<b>Ministry</b>
Lucy’s current ministry focuses on international students and scholars. She partners with the InterVarsity’s International Student Chapter at the University of Texas in Austin. She is involved with outreach and discipleship. She enjoys engaging in spiritual conversations, especially with non-believers. Lucy also has a heart for immigrants, refugees and the urban poor. She is actively involved in schools in the Rundberg neighborhood of Austin to help bring resources to those in need.

<b>Personal Message</b>
I truly appreciate both your prayer and financial support as we partner together to reach the nations for Christ. International ministry is strategic because God brought the world to our doorstep and there is an openness in people’s hearts as they live far away from home. In sharing the Gospel and doing discipleship my prayers and hope are that these individuals will be the next generation of leaders and influencers in their community and country for our Lord Jesus. I am passionate to see the good news of God reach the ends of the earth.
