            <em>&ldquo;And how can anyone preach unless they are sent?…&rdquo; — ROMANS 10:15</em> 
            <br /><br />
            This verse is a wonderful representation of both the missionary and their support system. The Lord blesses some with the ability to give and provide for those He has called to go. For the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few. It is important that God’s people become involved in His work. We pray daily for those led to this site that they may hear His voice and support us or our missionaries as He leads. You can help in a number of ways.<br />
