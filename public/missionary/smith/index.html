<b>About</b>
Terrell serves the Lord in International Student Ministry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, leading a team of international students and community people who meet and welcome international students, scholars, professors, and their families. We show Christian love and share the Gospel through friendship, hospitality, weekly Bible studies, fellowship meetings, and time spent together. New believers are welcomed into Christian fellowship, taught Scripture, and given training in how to lead Bible studies, integrate faith into their whole lives, and to be witnesses for Christ when they return to their home countries.

Mary has a heart for ministry amongst women, meeting one-to-one to listen, care for, and pray with them.

Terrell served full-time with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship since 1971, in California, Wisconsin, and 11 years in Germany. He continues serving the Lord in International Student Ministry.

Terrell studied Physics and Geology at the University of California, Berkeley, during the tumultuous 60’s, and graduated with a degree in Geology. After a short time working for Chevron Oil making geological maps of the Far East, Terrell served as a Campus Intern with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship in California visiting three schools. He then moved to Wisconsin in 1971 as a regular Campus Staff Member, staffing and pioneering InterVarsity Christian Fellowship groups on more than 15 campuses, and in 1972 served as Wisconsin Team Leader. In 1978 he joined the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES) and moved to Germany, where he pioneered the International Student Ministry in Germany (including a hospitality program for international students), regularly visited 40 groups, and helped pioneer international student ministry in Switzerland, Norway, and other countries. Terrell and Mary were married in 1979, ministered to internationals in Germany for 11 years, and have three adult children. Mary has a degree in Linguistics from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Terrell authored “Die Welt vor deiner Haustür” (The World at Your Doorstep, published in German). He also co-authored “Passport to the Bible” and other InterVarsity Press books. The Smiths moved back to the United States in 1989. Mary taught German part-time, worked at the local YMCA, tutored English as a Second Language, and has worked in Food Service at three of Madison’s public schools. Terrell served as national Training Coordinator for InterVarsity’s International Student Ministries, visiting and training ISM staff in three regions, was Director of the International Students Track at Urbana ’06, and Acting Director of International Student Ministries of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. In 2004, the Smiths taught English and American Culture for two months in Mainland China as part of one of InterVarsity’s Global Projects.

Before joining Y.E.S., Terrell was Senior Campus Staff Member in International Student Ministry with InterVarsity’s Graduate &amp; Faculty Ministries at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Terrell is an author, trainer, pioneer, evangelist, speaker, web site designer, photographer, enjoys computers and playing ping pong. Terrell’s greatest joy is explaining the Good News about Jesus to interested international students. Mary recently spent much of her summer caring for her aging mother, and building relationships with staff and other residents in a retirement home. We’re a thankful family - to God for His love to us, and thankful for each other.
