<b>About</b>
In 2003 Raquel leaves her country Dominican Republic to study to Word of Life Bible Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina... completed her theological studies in three years... obeying the call of God was in the institute as a missionary, working in administration office and first assistant director ...
Federico (Fefo) came from Neuquén, Argentina to Word of Life in 2005, he worked as manager of the sports area, also finished his theological studies in three years. Raquel and Fefo met in that time and had a dating relationship surrounded by friends and in dependence on the Lord...
Fefo heard the call to missions and in January 2007 visited Dominican as his first missionary trip ... God confirmed His call.
On March 14, 2008 God blessed Raquel and Fefo with a beautiful wedding! They came to Dominican Rep. on May 14, 2008 full of excitement and gratitude to serve the Lord in missions!
On June 21, 2011 God rewarded with the arrival of Enzo! a little missionary!! He accompanies them to all places of ministry and they give thanks to God for the privilege!

<b>Ministry</b>
2008-2009 ministering in Churches, Gospel Crusades, Groups missionaries, evangelists medical groups, ect.
2010 God allowed us to help Haiti after the earthquake... we're traveling for 6 times that year... and was a great blessing! Work in construction, VBS, and ministering in different churches!
God has allowed us to travel around Dominican ministering His Word everywhere...
It's been great to see the power of God in different provinces so closed to receive Christ.
In Puerto Plata city where we are living, we are ministering the Word in schools, evangelism, discipleship, counseling, camps and several churches.
We are now working with a church in the community of Guananico... a small town very Catholic but many beautiful people!.. We travel 100 kms with badly damaged roads every Wednesday to give Bible studies and worship usually on Saturdays..

<b>Personal Message</b>
Please pray for wisdom, for our family and ministry, for health and for the financial support. We believe that God has led us this far, has shown us His will that has been good, pleasing and perfect! Want to be part of the work in the Dominican? Pray for us, we invite you to come to this country and work together!
Blessings
